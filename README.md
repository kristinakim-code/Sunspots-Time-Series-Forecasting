# Sunspots-Time-Series-Forecasting
# Project Title: 
# Sunspots Numbers Time Series Forecasting (Daily, Monthly, Yearly)
# Project Objective:
# In this project, I create a times series forecasting model for daily, monthly, and yearly sunspot trends.
# Project Process:
# I use libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to clean and format the data for the forecasting model. 
# Then, I use FBProphet to create the model and fit for the daily, monthly, and yearly data.
# Lastly, I tune various parameters such as seasonality and growth to improve the model as much as possible.
# Project Challenges and Future Improvements:
# I wanted to create a forecast function that took any data whether daily, monthly, or yearly and different periods. This process was difficult because I had to ensure that all the variables were properly defined and that it produced the correct output.
# For most of my models, there was at least one error rate that worsened after the tuning, particularly the MAPE. This was due to many 0 and -1 values in the dataset, so I prioritized the other error rates in the end.
# How to Run:
# Download attached CSV files and run the Jupyter Notebooks. Ensure that you change the second cell (reading the file) in all the notebooks to the directory in your personal device.
